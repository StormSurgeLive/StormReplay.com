Quick Start:
------------

1. start the FTP server if it's not already started;

  $ cd docker-vsftpd
  $ docker-compose -d up 

Note: docker-vsftpd/docker-compose.yml is set to restart
on host boot, at the time of this writing;

2. start web application;

  $ cd ReplayServerApp/
  $ sudo ./bin/starman.sh

3. in another terminal (I use tmux), start the replayd daemon

  $ cd ReplayServerApp/
  $ ./bin/replayd

Testing Notes:

a. the web app is essentially a single file application, contained
   in the file ./lib/StormSurgeApp/ReplayServer.pm

b. ./bin/nowify is a commandline tool that uses the same module,
   lib/StormSurgeLive/Nowify.pm that the bin/replayd uses when
   it determines a storm is ready to be nowified; this file *is*
   in the repo but contains things that should be in the repo,
   like the AWS SES SMTP credentials

c. email notifications sent by ./bin/replayd are implemented in
   the module, lib/StormSurgeLive/Notify.pm

d. storms are currently defined as part of ./config.yaml (but should
   be moved out eventually)

e. user credentials for both the WWW UI and the API client are in
   the file, ./passwd.yaml; but is not in the git repo
